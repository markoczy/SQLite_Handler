# SQLite_Handler

## Description

DLL to handle SQLite commands, entirely based on sqlite.h. Can be used in C++ / C# / Java Projects (Windows only)

The reason why I created this project is that I needed a SQLite Ttool that is easy to understand and use. 
People who were already working with sqlite.h know that all SELECT statements trigger a callback function to store the
return values. This was very unhandy to me... 

## Purpose

- Can execute SQL Statements (SELECT, INSERT, etc.) on SQLite DB's
- Stores all values of a SELECT statement for direct access (no callback)
